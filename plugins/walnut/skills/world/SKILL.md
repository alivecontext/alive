description: "Use when the conductor wants a dashboard view of all active walnuts, feels lost, or is unsure what to work on next. Renders a live world view grouped by ALIVE domain — priorities, attention items, full walnut tree, and recent activity — then routes to open, housekeeping, find, or recall."

# World

This is Mission Control. When the conductor opens their world, it should feel like booting an operating system — everything they care about, at a glance, with clear paths to action.

NOT a database dump. NOT a flat list. A living view of their world, grouped by what matters, showing relationships, surfacing what needs attention.

---

## Load Sequence

1. Find the ALIVE world root (walk up from PWD looking for `01_Archive/` + `02_Life/`)
2. Scan all `_core/key.md` files — extract type, goal, phase, health, rhythm, next, updated, people, links, parent
3. Scan all `_core/now.md` files — extract health status, last updated, next action
4. Build the tree — parent/child relationships from `parent:` field in key.md
5. Compute attention items
6. Surface API context if configured (Gmail, Slack, Calendar via preferences.yaml)

## State Detection

Before rendering, detect system state:

- **Fresh install** (no walnuts exist) → route to `setup.md`
- **Stale rules** (plugin version > project rules version) → route to `upgrade.md`
- **Previous system detected** (v3/v4 `_brain/` folders exist) → route to `upgrade.md`
- **Normal** → render dashboard

---

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard has 4 sections. Each tells the conductor something different.

### Section 1: Right Now

What needs you TODAY. Not everything — just what's active and demanding.

```
╭─ 🐿️ your world
│
│  RIGHT NOW
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
│
│   1. alive-gtm              building
│      Next: Test plugin install end-to-end
│      Last: 2 hours ago · 6 sessions this week
│
│   2. sovereign-systems       launching
│      Next: Set up Cloudflare API for DNS
│      Last: 2 days ago
│      People: Will Adler, Attila Mora
│
│   3. supernormal-systems     legacy
│      Next: Send 9 client email drafts
│      ⚠ 4 days past rhythm
│
╰─
```

Only show walnuts that are `active` or past their rhythm. Sort by most recently touched. Show:
- Phase
- Next action (from now.md)
- Last activity (relative time)
- People involved (from key.md — max 2-3 names)
- Warning if past rhythm

### Section 2: Attention

Things that need the conductor's decision or action. Not walnuts — specific issues.

```
╭─ 🐿️ attention
│
│   → 3 unread emails from Will (Gmail, 2 days)
│   → Unsigned session on alive-gtm (squirrel:a3f7, 6 stash items)
│   → 03_Inputs/ has 2 items older than 48 hours
│   → peptide-calculator quiet for 12 days (rhythm: weekly)
│   → 4 working files older than 30 days across 3 walnuts
│
╰─
```

Sources:
- **Inputs buffer (HIGH PRIORITY)** — anything in `03_Inputs/` older than 48 hours. These are unrouted context that could impact active walnuts TODAY. The squirrel should stress this to the conductor: "You have unrouted inputs. These might contain decisions, tasks, or context that affects your active work. Route them before diving into a walnut."
- API context (Gmail unread, Slack mentions, Calendar upcoming)
- Unsigned squirrel entries with stash items
- Stale walnuts (quiet/waiting)
- Stale working files

**Inputs triage:** The world skill should understand that inputs are a buffer — content arrives there and needs routing to its proper walnut. When surfacing inputs, the squirrel should scan the companion frontmatter (if companions exist) or the file names to understand what the content might relate to. Don't digest the full content — just flag it, estimate which walnuts it might affect, and urge the conductor to route it. Use `walnut:capture` to process each input properly.

### Section 3: Your World (the tree)

The full structure — grouped by ALIVE domain, with parent/child nesting visible.

```
╭─ 🐿️ your world
│
│  LIFE
│   identity           active     XRP panel Feb 27

│
│  INPUTS
│   2 items (oldest: 4 days)
│
│  ARCHIVE
│   1 walnut (fangrid)
│
╰─
```

Key features:
- **Grouped by ALIVE domain** — not a flat list
- **Parent/child nesting** — sub-walnuts indented under parents with `└`
- **People** shown under Life with last-updated
- **Collapse quiet/waiting** — if there are 6+ quiet experiments, show the count not the full list
- **Inputs count** — just how many and how old
- **Archive count** — just the number
- **5-day activity indicator** — `●` dot for each of the last 5 days the walnut was touched. Visual pulse at a glance.

```
│   alive-gtm          ●●●●● building   Test plugin
│   sovereign-systems  ●●○○○ launching   Cloudflare API
│   ghost-protocol     ○○○○○ waiting     Decide: rewrite or revise
```

`●` = touched that day. `○` = no activity. Read left to right: today, yesterday, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days. Five dots tells you this walnut is hot. Zero tells you it's cold. No numbers, no dates — just a visual heartbeat.

### Section 4: Recent Squirrel Activity

What's been happening across the world. A pulse check.

```
╭─ 🐿️ recent activity
│
│   Today     alive-gtm         6 sessions · shipped v0.1-beta

## Rendering Rules

1. **Right Now comes first.** Always. It answers "what should I work on?"
2. **Attention is actionable.** Every item should have a clear next step.
3. **The tree is scannable.** Indent sub-walnuts. Collapse where sensible. Show people under Life.
4. **Recent activity gives pulse.** Not details — just "what's been happening."
5. **Numbers for navigation.** Any walnut with a number can be opened by typing the number.
6. **Don't show everything.** Waiting walnuts can be collapsed. Quiet experiments get a count. The conductor asks for more if they want it.

---

## After Dashboard

- **Number** → open that walnut (invoke `walnut:open`)
- **"just chat"** → freestyle conversation, no walnut focus
- **"housekeeping"** → invoke `walnut:housekeeping`
- **"find X"** → invoke `walnut:find`
- **"recall"** → invoke `walnut:recall`
- **"open [name]"** → open a specific walnut
- **Attention item** → address it directly ("deal with those emails", "sign that session")

---

## API Context (preferences.yaml)

If the conductor has configured context sources in `.home/preferences.yaml`, surface relevant items:

- **Gmail (MCP live):** Unread count, recent senders, anything flagged
- **Slack (sync script):** Unread mentions, DMs
- **Calendar (MCP live):** Today's events, upcoming deadlines
- **Other sources:** Only if they have new/relevant items

Only show API context that's actionable. "3 unread emails from Will" is useful. "You have 847 emails" is not.

Filter API context by walnut scoping — only show sources relevant to active walnuts (from preferences.yaml `walnuts:` field).

---

## Internal Modes

These have their own .md files in this skill directory. They are NOT separately invocable — they trigger automatically based on state detection.

- `setup.md` — first-time world creation
- `calibrate.md` — progressive 30-day context extraction
- `upgrade.md` — version migration from previous systems
